## Design and implementation

The design of this application is minimalistic to get started with code examples on PSOC&trade; Edge MCU devices. All PSOC&trade; Edge E84 MCU applications have a dual-CPU three-project structure to develop code for the CM33 and CM55 cores. The CM33 core has two separate projects for the secure processing environment (SPE) and non-secure processing environment (NSPE). A project folder consists of various subfolders, each denoting a specific aspect of the project. The three project folders are as follows:

**Table 1. Application projects**

Project | Description
--------|------------------------
*proj_cm33_s* | Project for CM33 secure processing environment (SPE)
*proj_cm33_ns* | Project for CM33 non-secure processing environment (NSPE)
*proj_cm55* | CM55 project

In this code example, at device reset, the secure boot process starts from the ROM boot with the secure enclave (SE) as the root of trust (RoT). From the secure enclave, the boot flow is passed on to the system CPU subsystem where the secure CM33 application starts. After all necessary secure configurations, the flow is passed on to the non-secure CM33 application. Resource initialization for this example is performed by this CM33 non-secure project. It configures the system clocks, pins, clock to peripheral connections, and other platform resources. It then enables the CM55 core using the `Cy_SysEnableCM55()` function and the CM55 core is subsequently put to DeepSleep mode.

In the CM33 non-secure application, the clocks and system resources are initialized by the BSP initialization function. The retarget-io middleware is configured to use the debug UART and then the Bluetooth&reg; device boots up, initializes the BTSTACK, sets the two sets of advertisement data, and starts the advertisement.

The ‘Bluetooth&reg; LE Multi Beacon’ is a GAP Broadcaster. It advertises one Eddystone data: URL (www.infineon.com) and one iBeacon packet: UUID. It uses the multi_advertisement functions to set data and parameters for two sets of advertisement. There are utility functions that help to set the advertisement data in the specific format required by the Eddystone and iBeacon specifications.
